# Secure Data Manager

A **C++ Secure Data Manager** that encrypts and decrypts sensitive client information from a file. This project aims to create a structured and efficient system for managing sensitive data securely while maintaining ease of access and usability.

## 🚀 Project Goals
- **Encryption & Decryption**: Implement secure encryption and decryption mechanisms using **OpenSSL**.
- **Fast Lookups**: Optimize data retrieval with **unordered_map**.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Design a **menu-based system** for users to:
  - View encrypted and decrypted data.
  - Add new entries.
  - Delete entries.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Structure the project with clear distinctions between:
  - **Encryption/Decryption Module** (Handles security aspects)
  - **Data Management Module** (Manages file operations and lookups)
  - **Frontend (Future Plan)**: A **HTML, CSS, JavaScript UI** to interact with the backend.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
- **C++** for backend logic.
- **OpenSSL** for encryption.
- **Unordered_map** for efficient data management.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the frontend (planned).

## 📝 Current Progress
- [ ] Researching and setting up **OpenSSL** for encryption.
- [ ] Implementing a structured **C++ header file (.hpp)**.
- [ ] Developing the **file handling system**.
- [ ] Designing the **CLI-based menu**.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- **Error handling & logging** for robustness.
- **User authentication system** for additional security.
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Linux & Windows support).
- **Front-end UI** to improve accessibility and user interaction.

## 📌 Why This Project?
This project is an opportunity to **deep dive into cryptography**, **low-level C++**, and **systems design** while creating something practical and resume-worthy. It also helps build **real-world skills** in handling sensitive data securely.

## 📅 Roadmap
1. **Complete the C++ backend** with a working encryption system.
2. **Refine the data storage & retrieval mechanism**.
3. **Implement a simple UI** for a seamless user experience.
4. **Test & optimize performance** for large datasets.
5. **Expand with authentication and security layers**.
